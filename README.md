# ADAPT Standard issue management

## Introduction

The purpose of this repository is to store the ADAPT Standard schema and related documentation, as well as to manage ADAPT Standard issues. The ADAPT Standard-related issues are managed in a [GitHub project](https://github.com/ADAPT/Standard/projects/1). Each issue is in a state as specified below.

## Supplementary discussion page

For discussion content that stakeholders feel is not well supported by this repo, consider the following AgGateway Confluence page: [ADAPT Standard changes discussion](https://aggateway.atlassian.net/wiki/x/AwDGxg)
